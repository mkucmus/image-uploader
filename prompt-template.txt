Generate a photorealistic product image for a Scandinavian-style handcrafted furniture e-commerce store.

Style guidelines:
- Warm, muted neutral background: soft taupe, warm gray, or light beige tones
- Scandinavian minimalist aesthetic with natural, organic feel
- Warm natural lighting, as if in a cozy well-lit room with soft diffused shadows
- Product centered in frame, shown at a slight angle to reveal craftsmanship and form
- Emphasize natural wood grain, texture, and material quality
- Sustainably crafted, timeless design feel — not trendy, but enduring
- Subtle lifestyle context: a hint of a room setting (wooden floor, neutral wall) without clutter

- High quality, photorealistic rendering with editorial photography feel
- No text, watermarks, logos, or people in the image
